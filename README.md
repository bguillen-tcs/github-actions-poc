# GitHub Actions POC

## Description

Simple POC to get more familiar with GitHub Actions.  The goal with this POC is to create a simple workflow that runs one job, printing out `node` and `npm` versions.

It's pretty pointless, but the point is to just start with a small example to put the general concepts into practice.

Given all the above, below, you'll see "_Commit N_".  This is where I'll add content to the README, in order to practice triggering the workflow more than once.
